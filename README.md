# The N-queens problem: local search algorithms implementation

This project aims to compare chosen local search algorithms used to solve the N-queens puzzle problem. The implemented search algorithms are
- genetic algorithm,
- hill-climbing algorithm,
- local beam search algorithm,
- simulated annealing algorithm.'

### How to Launch
After downloading the project run the *index.html* file in your browser to launch the program.

### Interface
The interface of this project allows studying the behaviour of the algorithms by changing their parameters.
